In order to visualize GeoJSON polygons for Apple Maps I built a simple GeoJSON Viewer. I built it since
there wasn't anything similar. It uses Google Maps.

Right now, it covers the GeoJSON features that Apple supports for their Maps. Perhaps, in the future I will include full support for GeoJSON.

Check the [demo](http://jansanchez.com/geojson-viewer) or [fork it](https://github.com/jansanz/geojson-viewer).
